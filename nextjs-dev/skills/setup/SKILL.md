# Verify Next.js Project Setup

Confirm that a Next.js project is properly configured for modern App Router development. Run these checks in order and report results.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 or 24 LTS recommended. Next.js 16 formally requires `>=20.9.0`, but Node 20 reached end-of-life on 2026-04-30 and no longer gets fixes; Vitest 5 needs Node >= 22.12
- TypeScript 5.1+
- A Next.js project directory with `package.json`

## Step 1: Check Next.js Version

Read `package.json` and locate the `next` dependency. The recommended range is `^16.3.8`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "^16.3.8"
  }
}
```

| Version | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| 16.3.x, at 16.3.8 or later | Current | Cache Components, Turbopack default, `proxy.ts`, built-in MCP at `/_next/mcp` |
| 16.x below 16.3.8 | Patch now | Missing security fixes: RCE on Windows-hosted servers and via AVIF in Image Optimization (16.3.3), RCE in `next/og` `ImageResponse` (16.3.6), and in 16.3.8 an SSRF in Image Optimization, Draft Mode and root-param leaks in `use cache`, and `/_next/mcp` without an origin check |
| 15.x | Maintenance | Backport releases only; stay on 15.5.27 or later. `middleware.ts` era, no built-in MCP |
| 14.x | Legacy | App Router GA, consider upgrading |
| 13.x or below | Outdated | Upgrade required for modern patterns |

Verify the installed (not just the declared) version and the registry latest:

```bash
npm ls next
npm view next@latest version   # compare: installed must be >= 16.3.8 on the 16.3 line
```

Next.js ships a formal monthly security-release program (since 2026-07-13), so re-run this check each month instead of leaving an old range in place.

## Step 2: Verify App Router Structure

Check that the project uses the `app/` directory (not just `pages/`):

```
app/
├── layout.tsx       # Root layout (required)
├── page.tsx         # Home page
├── loading.tsx      # Optional loading state
├── error.tsx        # Optional error boundary
└── not-found.tsx    # Optional 404 page
```

If only `pages/` exists, the project uses the legacy Pages Router. Recommend migrating to App Router for new features.

## Step 3: Verify TypeScript Configuration

Check for `tsconfig.json` with Next.js recommended settings:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2017",
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "strict": true,
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    },
    "plugins": [{ "name": "next" }]
  }
}
```

Key checks:
- `strict: true` is set
- Path aliases (`@/*`) are configured
- The `next` plugin is present for IDE support

## Step 4: Verify Next.js Config

Check for `next.config.ts` (TypeScript) or `next.config.mjs`:

```ts
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  // Configuration options
}

export default nextConfig
```

The config file can be `next.config.ts` natively (TypeScript is fully supported). Common configuration to verify:
- `images.remotePatterns` — if using external image domains
- `cacheComponents` — must be `true` for `use cache` / Cache Components (16+). Record whether it is on: it decides which caching model applies (`export const revalidate` / `dynamic` work only when it is off, and are removed when it is on — see the `data-fetching` skill)
- `experimental` — any experimental features enabled
- `output` — `'standalone'` for Docker deployments

## Step 5: Check Dev Server

Run the development server to confirm it starts:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Verify the server starts on `http://localhost:3000` without errors.

## Step 6: Verify MCP Integration (Next.js 16+)

For Next.js 16+, the built-in MCP endpoint is available at `/_next/mcp` when the dev server is running. Use `next@>=16.3.8` for it: earlier dev servers did not verify the request origin, so a website the developer visits could read project data from the endpoint. Check for `.mcp.json` in the project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "next-devtools": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "next-devtools-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or install with one command: `npx add-mcp next-devtools-mcp@latest`.

If not present, recommend adding it for enhanced AI-assisted development.

## Optional: CI Type Checking

Recommend `next typegen && npx tsc --noEmit` in CI — `next typegen` generates route and `PageProps` types without a full build.

## What This Skill Does NOT Cover

- Installing Node.js or package managers — see Node.js official docs
- Creating a new project from scratch — use `npx create-next-app@latest`
- Configuring MCP servers — that belongs to project-level `.mcp.json` configuration
- Setting up CI/CD or deployment — see deployment guides
