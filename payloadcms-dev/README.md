# payloadcms-dev (Pi extension)

PayloadCMS dev plugin for Agents Store. Covers collections, fields, globals, hooks, access control, authentication, queries, data management (trash/query presets/folders), localization, adapters, Lexical rich text, admin customization, jobs queue, plugin development, official plugins, Next.js integration, deployment, CLI, migrations, and end-to-end scenarios for TypeScript developers building with Payload v3.

## Install

Project-local (auto-discovered once the project is trusted):

```bash
cp -r .pi/ /path/to/your-project/
cp -r skills /path/to/your-project/
```

Global:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/extensions
cp .pi/extensions/payloadcms-dev.ts ~/.pi/agent/extensions/
```

Note: the extension resolves `skills/` two directories up from itself (`.pi/extensions/payloadcms-dev.ts` -> project root -> `skills/`). For a global install, also copy `skills/` next to `~/.pi/agent/` (i.e. `~/.pi/skills/`), or edit the `skillsDir` line in the extension file.

Quick test without installing: `pi -e ./.pi/extensions/payloadcms-dev.ts`
