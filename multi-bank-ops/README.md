# multi-bank-ops (Pi extension)

Multi-Bank Account Manager with broadcast architecture pattern. Aggregates financial data from Monobank and PrivatBank via MCP tools, broadcasts balance updates and budget alerts to subscribed components, categorizes transactions, and exports financial reports in CSV/PDF.

## Install

Project-local (auto-discovered once the project is trusted):

```bash
cp -r .pi/ /path/to/your-project/
cp -r skills /path/to/your-project/
```

Global:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/extensions
cp .pi/extensions/multi-bank-ops.ts ~/.pi/agent/extensions/
```

Note: the extension resolves `skills/` two directories up from itself (`.pi/extensions/multi-bank-ops.ts` -> project root -> `skills/`). For a global install, also copy `skills/` next to `~/.pi/agent/` (i.e. `~/.pi/skills/`), or edit the `skillsDir` line in the extension file.

Quick test without installing: `pi -e ./.pi/extensions/multi-bank-ops.ts`

## Skills (15)

- `bank-api-integration` — This skill should be used when connecting to bank MCP servers, fetching account balances or transaction statements, handling MCP connection errors, or understanding bank API data formats. Relevant for queries like "show my balance", "connect my bank", "fetch last month transactions", or "why is my bank connection failing". Use this skill whenever the user mentions bank accounts, balances, transactions, MCP connections, or any bank data operation, even if they don't explicitly mention "API" or "MCP".
- `bank-balances` — This skill should be used when showing account balances across all connected banks as a unified table. It covers the BROADCAST pattern for fetching balances from every bank simultaneously and merging them into one view. Use this skill whenever the user asks about their balance, account totals, how much money they have, or wants to see all accounts — even if they only mention one bank, because the plugin always queries all connected banks.
- `bank-reports` — This skill should be used when generating analytical financial reports — spending by category, income vs expenses, period comparisons, or spending trends across all connected banks. Use this skill whenever the user asks for a financial summary, analytics, spending breakdown, income report, period comparison, or any aggregated view of their financial data, even if they just say "where does my money go" or "скільки я витратив цього місяця".

It covers fetching transactions via BROADCAST, merging results, date range handling, and pagination across different bank APIs.
