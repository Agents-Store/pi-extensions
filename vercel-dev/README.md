# vercel-dev (Pi extension)

Vercel ecosystem plugin. Deployment, AI SDK, Edge Functions, storage, routing, performance optimization. Includes CLI deploy troubleshooting for non-Git projects, Hobby plan fixes, standalone output handling. Based on official vercel-plugin v0.25.0 by Vercel Labs.

## Install

Project-local (auto-discovered once the project is trusted):

```bash
cp -r .pi/ /path/to/your-project/
cp -r skills /path/to/your-project/
```

Global:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/extensions
cp .pi/extensions/vercel-dev.ts ~/.pi/agent/extensions/
```

Note: the extension resolves `skills/` two directories up from itself (`.pi/extensions/vercel-dev.ts` -> project root -> `skills/`). For a global install, also copy `skills/` next to `~/.pi/agent/` (i.e. `~/.pi/skills/`), or edit the `skillsDir` line in the extension file.

Quick test without installing: `pi -e ./.pi/extensions/vercel-dev.ts`
