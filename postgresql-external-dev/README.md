# postgresql-external-dev (Pi extension)

PostgreSQL knowledge for low-code stacks. Schema design for external database connections (compatible SQL patterns for NocoDB and NocoBase — table creation, column types, relations, indexes, anti-patterns), plus the 29-tool PostgreSQL MCP reference and the PostgREST REST API.

## Install

Project-local (auto-discovered once the project is trusted):

```bash
cp -r .pi/ /path/to/your-project/
cp -r skills /path/to/your-project/
```

Global:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/extensions
cp .pi/extensions/postgresql-external-dev.ts ~/.pi/agent/extensions/
```

Note: the extension resolves `skills/` two directories up from itself (`.pi/extensions/postgresql-external-dev.ts` -> project root -> `skills/`). For a global install, also copy `skills/` next to `~/.pi/agent/` (i.e. `~/.pi/skills/`), or edit the `skillsDir` line in the extension file.

Quick test without installing: `pi -e ./.pi/extensions/postgresql-external-dev.ts`

## Skills (8)

- `column-types` — This skill should be used when the user asks "what SQL type for", "which column type", "NocoDB column types", "NocoBase field types", "type compatibility", "how to store email/url/phone/json/rating", "what type for currency", "decimal vs double", "jsonb", "uuid column", "ARRAY column", "PostgreSQL enum", or needs to choose the correct PostgreSQL type that works in both NocoDB and NocoBase.

- `create-tables` — This skill should be used when the user asks to "create a table", "design a schema", "set up a database", "create PostgreSQL tables for NocoDB", "create tables for NocoBase external DB", "what PK type to use", "UUID primary key", "table without a primary key", "does NocoBase need a license", or needs to understand how NocoDB and NocoBase interact with the same PostgreSQL database.

- `examples` — This skill should be used when the user asks for a "full example", "complete schema", "e-commerce schema", "blog schema", "CRM schema", "content management schema", "show me a real schema", "sample database", "end-to-end example", or wants to see a complete working PostgreSQL schema with all tables, constraints, indexes, and relations that is compatible with NocoDB and NocoBase.

- `modify-schema` — This skill should be used when the user asks to "alter a table", "rename a column", "change column type", "drop a column", "drop a table", "remove a constraint", "delete a junction table", "add default value", "set NOT NULL", "sync schema", "meta sync", "refresh data source", "NocoDB doesn't show the new column", or needs to modify an existing PostgreSQL schema that is connected to NocoDB or NocoBase.

- `postgres-mcp-tools` — This skill should be used when the user wants to "run SQL through MCP", "use the PostgreSQL MCP tools", "execute_sql", "inspect a database schema over MCP", "list indexes, locks or bloated tables", "analyze query performance with MCP", "check database status", "get a query plan", "MCP Toolbox for Databases", or needs the tool reference of the 29-tool PostgreSQL MCP server for querying and administering a PostgreSQL database.
- `postgrest-api` — This skill should be used when the user wants to "use PostgREST", "make REST calls to PostgreSQL", "CRUD over HTTP on a PostgreSQL table", "upsert with on_conflict", "Prefer header options", "return=representation", "max-affected", "call a stored function over REST", "read PostgreSQL from an n8n HTTP Request node", or "read PostgreSQL from a Trigger.dev task with fetch".
- `relations` — This skill should be used when the user asks to "create a relation", "add foreign key", "set up one-to-many", "many-to-many relation", "one-to-one", "self-referential", "junction table", "composite primary key", "FK constraint", "create index on FK", or needs to connect tables in a PostgreSQL database that works with NocoDB and NocoBase.

- `troubleshoot` — This skill should be used when the user asks about "incompatible types", "what to avoid", "schema checklist", "NocoDB doesn't recognize", "NocoBase can't read", "ARRAY not working", "ENUM alternative", "jsonb support", "UUID primary key problem", "external PostgreSQL missing in NocoBase", "naming conventions", "validation checklist", or encounters issues with a PostgreSQL schema connected to NocoDB or NocoBase.
