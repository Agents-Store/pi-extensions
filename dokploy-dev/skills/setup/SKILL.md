# Dokploy Setup and Verification

Verify all three access methods to Dokploy: MCP tools, CLI, and REST API. Run each step in order. Report the result of each step before moving to the next.

---

## Prerequisites

The plugin needs two values — the Dokploy **base URL** (no `/api` suffix) and an **access token** — wired into all three interfaces:

| Interface | How it reads credentials | What to set |
|---|---|---|
| **MCP** (`@dokploy/mcp`) | `.mcp.json` `env` block expands `${DOKPLOY_URL}` / `${DOKPLOY_API_KEY}` from the Claude Code environment (e.g. the `env` block of `.claude/settings.local.json`, or your shell) | `DOKPLOY_URL`, `DOKPLOY_API_KEY` |
| **REST API** (`curl`) | Same env vars in your shell | `DOKPLOY_URL`, `DOKPLOY_API_KEY` |
| **CLI** (`@dokploy/cli`) | Reads the SAME `DOKPLOY_URL`/`DOKPLOY_API_KEY` env vars (or a CWD `.env`); falls back to `config.json` written by `dokploy auth -u <url> -t <token>` | `DOKPLOY_URL`, `DOKPLOY_API_KEY` (or run `dokploy auth`) |

- `DOKPLOY_URL` = the server **base URL without `/api`** (e.g. `https://dokploy.example.com`). MCP and REST endpoints live at `/api/…` under it.
- `DOKPLOY_API_KEY` = an access token from **Settings > API/Tokens** (or **Settings > Profile**). The **same token** works for MCP, REST, and the CLI.

Before verifying, confirm `DOKPLOY_URL` and `DOKPLOY_API_KEY` resolve to real values in the session environment. If either is missing, the MCP server fails with **"Invalid URL"** (empty `DOKPLOY_URL`) or **401** (bad key).

### Optional: reduce the exposed tool surface

The official `@dokploy/mcp` server exposes 546 tools across 50 categories. If that is more than you need, set `DOKPLOY_ENABLED_TAGS` in the plugin's `.mcp.json` `env` block to a comma-separated list of categories (e.g. `project,application,domain,compose,postgres,settings,deployment,docker`). The server will then only expose tools from those categories. (`DOKPLOY_TOOL_PRESET` and `DOKPLOY_DISABLED_TAGS` are unreleased — merged upstream 2026-08-07, not in `@dokploy/mcp` 0.29.14, so the published package silently ignores them; use `DOKPLOY_ENABLED_TAGS` until the next release.)

### How to obtain an API key

1. Log in to the Dokploy dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Settings > API/Tokens**.
3. Click **Generate Token**.
4. Copy the token immediately — it is shown only once.

---

## Step 1: Verify MCP Connection

Call the MCP tool to list all projects:

```
mcp__dokploy__project-all
```

**No parameters required.**

### Expected result

A JSON array of project objects. Even an empty array `[]` confirms the MCP connection is working.

### If the call succeeds

Report: "MCP connection verified. Found N project(s)."

### If the call fails

Check these causes in order:

1. **MCP server not running** — The `.mcp.json` file must point to a running Dokploy MCP server. Verify the `command` and `args` fields are correct.
2. **Environment variables missing** — The MCP server needs `DOKPLOY_URL` and `DOKPLOY_API_KEY` passed via `env` in `.mcp.json`. Confirm they resolve to real values.
3. **npx resolution failure** — If the MCP server is launched via `npx`, ensure `@dokploy/mcp` is available. Run:
   ```bash
   npx @dokploy/mcp --version
   ```
4. **Network unreachable** — The MCP server connects to the Dokploy API. If the server is on a private network, verify the machine running Claude Code can reach it.

Report the specific error message from the MCP call to help diagnose.

---

## Step 2: Verify CLI Installation

Check the CLI is installed, then make a real call (there is NO `dokploy verify` command in the 0.29.x auto-generated CLI):

```bash
dokploy --version        # versions in lockstep with Dokploy, e.g. 0.29.14
dokploy project all      # real API call — succeeds only when auth works
```

### If the commands succeed

Report: "Dokploy CLI is installed and authenticated."

### If `dokploy` is not found

Install the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @dokploy/cli
```

Then authenticate — non-interactive:

```bash
dokploy auth -u https://dokploy.example.com -t $DOKPLOY_API_KEY
```

Or simply export `DOKPLOY_URL` / `DOKPLOY_API_KEY` — the CLI reads the **same env vars** as MCP/REST, and env wins over `config.json`.

- **Server URL** — the Dokploy instance URL (e.g. `https://dokploy.example.com`). Do NOT include `/api` suffix for CLI auth.
- **Access token** — the same token used for `DOKPLOY_API_KEY` (Settings > API/Tokens). `dokploy auth` validates it against `/api/trpc/user.get` and saves it to the CLI's `config.json`.

After authentication, re-run:

```bash
dokploy project all
```

### If authentication fails

Check these causes:

1. **Wrong URL format** — The CLI expects the base URL without `/api`. If `dokploy_url` is `https://dokploy.example.com/api`, use `https://dokploy.example.com` for CLI auth.
2. **Expired token** — Generate a new token from the Dokploy dashboard.
3. **Self-signed certificate** — If the server uses a self-signed cert, set:
   ```bash
   export NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
   ```
   Then retry. This is acceptable for local/dev environments only.

---

## Step 3: Verify API Access

Make a direct HTTP request to the health endpoint:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
  "$DOKPLOY_URL/api/settings.health" \
  -H "x-api-key: $DOKPLOY_API_KEY"
```

Replace `$DOKPLOY_URL` (base URL, no `/api`) and `$DOKPLOY_API_KEY` with the actual configured values.

### Expected result

HTTP status code `200`.

### If 200 is returned

Report: "API access verified. Dokploy server is healthy."

### If a non-200 status is returned

| Status Code | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `401` | Invalid or expired API key | Generate a new token in **Settings > API/Tokens**. Also verify you used the `x-api-key` header (NOT `Authorization: Bearer`) |
| `403` | Token lacks required permissions | Check token scope — it must have admin access |
| `404` | Wrong URL path | `dokploy_url` must be the base URL **without** `/api` (e.g. `https://dokploy.example.com`). Append `/api/<endpoint>` in curl calls |
| `000` or connection refused | Server unreachable | Check URL, DNS, firewall rules, and that Dokploy is running |
| `502` / `503` | Server is starting or overloaded | Wait 30 seconds and retry |

### Additional API verification (optional)

To confirm full read/write access, call a non-destructive endpoint:

```bash
curl -s "$DOKPLOY_URL/api/project.all" \
  -H "x-api-key: $DOKPLOY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

This should return the same project list as the MCP call in Step 1.

## Verification Summary

After completing all three steps, produce a summary table:

| Check | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|
| MCP Connection | PASS/FAIL | N projects found / error message |
| CLI Installation | PASS/FAIL | Version / not installed |
| API Access | PASS/FAIL | HTTP 200 / status code |

If all three pass, report: "Dokploy setup is complete. All access methods are working."

If any step fails, provide the specific fix instructions from the relevant section above.

## Common Issues

| Problem | Symptoms | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| MCP not connecting | Tool calls return "server not found" or timeout | Verify `.mcp.json` exists, `npx @dokploy/mcp` works, and env vars are set |
| MCP returns "Invalid URL" | `DOKPLOY_URL` empty/wrong **in the running server process** | Set `DOKPLOY_URL` (base URL, no `/api`, no trailing slash), then **restart Claude Code or `/mcp` → reconnect `dokploy`** — a stdio MCP server reads env once at spawn and won't pick up edits to `settings.local.json`/`.env` until reconnected |
| MCP returns 401 "Authentication failed" | `DOKPLOY_API_KEY` invalid/stale in the running process | Fix the token, then reconnect the server (as above). Confirm `settings.local.json` and `.env` hold the **same** key |
| CLI auth fails | `dokploy auth` fails (401 / invalid) | Check the base URL has no `/api` suffix; regenerate the token. Env vars `DOKPLOY_URL`/`DOKPLOY_API_KEY` override `config.json` — make sure they're not stale |
| API 401 Unauthorized | `curl` returns 401 | Token expired or invalid — regenerate in dashboard |
| API connection refused | `curl` returns 000 or "connection refused" | Wrong URL, server down, or firewall blocking the port |
| Self-signed cert errors | `UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE` | Set `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` for dev environments |
| MCP tools exist but return errors | Tool calls return API errors | `dokploy_url` is the **base URL without `/api`** for MCP, REST, and CLI. MCP server and REST endpoints live at `/api/…` under that base |
| Wrong port | Connection refused on default port | Dokploy defaults to port 3000; verify the actual port in your deployment |
