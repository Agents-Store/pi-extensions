# project-template-dev (Pi extension)

Manage project template hierarchy with unified improvement workflow. Route fixes to plugins or parent templates automatically, quick-capture ideas for later, and run unified end-of-session reviews covering both plugins and templates.

## Install

Project-local (auto-discovered once the project is trusted):

```bash
cp -r .pi/ /path/to/your-project/
cp -r skills /path/to/your-project/
```

Global:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/extensions
cp .pi/extensions/project-template-dev.ts ~/.pi/agent/extensions/
```

Note: the extension resolves `skills/` two directories up from itself (`.pi/extensions/project-template-dev.ts` -> project root -> `skills/`). For a global install, also copy `skills/` next to `~/.pi/agent/` (i.e. `~/.pi/skills/`), or edit the `skillsDir` line in the extension file.

Quick test without installing: `pi -e ./.pi/extensions/project-template-dev.ts`

## Skills (10)

- `audit-stack` — Use when the user asks to "audit project stack", "analyze technologies", "scan dependencies", "generate stack.json", "what template level is this project", "map project to layers", or wants to discover all technologies in a codebase and get template and stack.json recommendations.

- `capture` — Use this skill when the user says "capture this", "note this for later", "remember to fix this", "save this improvement", "add to backlog", "I'll fix this later", or wants to quickly jot down an improvement idea without interrupting their current work. Defers routing and application to the wrap-up session.

- `create` — Use this skill when the user asks to "create a new template", "scaffold a Level 1 template", "create project-{stack}", "make a new stack template", "fork project-template", "create a demo template", "set up a new project from template", or wants to create any new project template at Level 1, 1.5, or 2 from the universal base or a stack template.

- `examples` — Use this skill when the user asks for "examples", "how does template feedback work", "show me a walkthrough", "demo the template workflow", or needs to see end-to-end scenario walkthroughs for the project-template-dev plugin.

- `feedback` — Use this skill when the user says "this should be in the parent template", "fix the template", "add this to project-template", "send feedback to parent", "improve the base template", "this skill belongs in the template", "update the parent", "push this up to the template", "the template needs this", "this is missing from the template", or discovers any issue while working in a child project that should be fixed in a parent template (Level 0 or Level 1).

- `improve` — Use this skill when the user says "improve", "this should be better", "fix this in the source", "this belongs in the plugin", "this belongs in the template", "push this upstream", "improve the plugin", "improve the template", or discovers any improvement while working in a child project that should go to either a plugin or a parent template. This is the unified entry point that auto-routes to the correct system.

- `sync` — Use this skill when the user says "sync from parent", "pull template changes", "merge parent template", "update from project-template", "my project is out of sync", "get latest template changes", "sync template", or needs to propagate improvements from a parent template (Level 0 or Level 1) down to a child project.

- `template-reference` — Use this skill when the user asks about "template hierarchy", "template levels", "project template conventions", "what files go in a template", "Level 0 vs Level 1", "template structure", "what belongs in the parent template", or needs reference documentation for the project template system and its 4-level hierarchy.

- `validate` — Use this skill when the user asks to "validate template", "check template structure", "is my template correct", "verify template conventions", "validate project template", "check template files", or needs to verify that a project template follows the Level 0/1/1.5/2 conventions and has all required files.

- `wrap-up` — Use this skill when the user says "wrap up", "end session", "done for today", "session review", "what should go into the template", "template improvements", "save template learnings", "review what we did for the template", "plugin improvements", "what should go into the plugin", or at the end of a work session to review what discoveries should be pushed up to parent templates or plugins.
