# nocobase-dev (Pi extension)

NocoBase v2 development plugin. Build, manage, and operate NocoBase through the `nb` CLI (primary) or REST API (fallback). Bundles 11 official upstream skills from nocobase/skills (auto-synced weekly via GitHub Action), 5 custom REST-API skills (overview, auth, cli-recipes, api-reference, examples), and the full OpenAPI 3.0.3 spec for NocoBase v2.1.0-beta.29 (272 endpoints across 19 tag groups). No MCP server. Env vars match upstream naming: NB_URL + NB_USER + NB_PASSWORD for sign-in flow, or NB_URL + NB_TOKEN for the long-lived API Key path.

## Install

Project-local (auto-discovered once the project is trusted):

```bash
cp -r .pi/ /path/to/your-project/
cp -r skills /path/to/your-project/
```

Global:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/extensions
cp .pi/extensions/nocobase-dev.ts ~/.pi/agent/extensions/
```

Note: the extension resolves `skills/` two directories up from itself (`.pi/extensions/nocobase-dev.ts` -> project root -> `skills/`). For a global install, also copy `skills/` next to `~/.pi/agent/` (i.e. `~/.pi/skills/`), or edit the `skillsDir` line in the extension file.

Quick test without installing: `pi -e ./.pi/extensions/nocobase-dev.ts`

## Skills (17)

- `api-reference` — Reference-only skill (loaded on demand) that maps the NocoBase v2 REST API surface — base URL, authentication, action-style endpoint convention, and pointers into the bundled OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification. Loaded by the model when it needs an exact endpoint path or schema; not auto-triggered.
- `auth` — Use when the user wants to authenticate to a NocoBase v2 instance, asks "how do I get a token for NocoBase", "how do I log in via API", "why is my request returning 401 from NocoBase", or needs working curl/Node samples that send the bearer token. Covers the upstream login flow (NB_USER + NB_PASSWORD → auth:signIn → token), the long-lived API Key path, and the OAuth IdP path.
- `cli-recipes` — Use when the user asks how to install or run NocoBase from the terminal — "install nb CLI", "how do I bootstrap NocoBase", "run nb commands", "start/stop NocoBase", "backup NocoBase", "nb pm". Provides install one-liner (`@nocobase/cli@beta`), the bootstrap-and-lifecycle recipes, and a routing table that hands deeper tasks to the upstream `nocobase-env-manage`, `nocobase-plugin-manage`, and `nocobase-publish-manage` skills.
- `examples` — Use when the user asks for an end-to-end example, walkthrough, or sample of doing something in NocoBase v2 — "show me how to", "walk me through", "give me a complete example", "sample script for NocoBase". Indexes worked scenarios that mix REST API and `nb` CLI calls.
- `nocobase-acl-manage` — Task-driven ACL governance through nb CLI for role lifecycle, global role mode, permission policy, user-role membership, and risk assessment. Use when users describe business permission outcomes instead of raw command arguments.
- `nocobase-ai-employee` — Use when a NocoBase task requires AI employee lifecycle work such as discovering existing employees, judging fit, creating a dedicated employee, or configuring profile, prompt, model, skills, tools, or knowledge base before another skill binds it to a UI surface.
- `nocobase-data-analysis` — Query and analyze business data in NocoBase via MCP. Use when users want current counts, grouped breakdowns, owner/source distributions, or business summaries across collections, with main data source first and fallback discovery to other enabled data sources.
- `nocobase-data-modeling` — Create and manage NocoBase data models through the available data-modeling surface. Use when users want to inspect or change collections, fields, relations, or view-backed schemas in a NocoBase app.
- `nocobase-dsl-reconciler` — **Opt-in DSL path** for NocoBase app building. Use ONLY when the user explicitly asks for YAML / DSL / committed-to-git / `cli push` / spec files — e.g. "use the DSL reconciler", "I want YAML I can commit", "build this as a workspaces/ project". For any other UI authoring request (new page, new block, tweak an existing screen), default to `nocobase-ui-builder` instead — this reconciler is still in active development and has rough edges that the live-UI path avoids.
When the user opts in: produces/changes files under `workspaces/<project>/`, supports new pages, menus, modules, whole systems, collections, tables, sub-tables, popups, dashboards, approval workflows, recordActions, and deploys them via `cli push`.
- `nocobase-env-manage` — Use when users need NocoBase bootstrap, runtime lifecycle, CLI maintenance, and skills maintenance with nb CLI only.
- `nocobase-plugin-development` — Step-by-step playbook for developing a NocoBase plugin, covering scaffolding, server-side code (collections, APIs, ACL, migrations), client-side code (blocks, fields, actions, settings pages, routes, components), i18n, and verification.
TRIGGER when: user asks to create, build, implement, or develop a NocoBase plugin, mentions 'NocoBase plugin', or describes a feature to be built as a NocoBase plugin. This skill contains NocoBase-specific conventions and templates that general coding cannot replicate — always invoke it instead of planning from scratch.
- `nocobase-plugin-manage` — Use when users need to inspect, enable, or disable NocoBase plugins with direct `nb plugin` commands only.
- `nocobase-publish-manage` — Use when users need NocoBase backup restore or migration publish operations through nb api backup and nb api migration commands.
- `nocobase-ui-builder` — DEFAULT entry point for NocoBase Modern UI authoring or tweaks: new pages, blocks, menu items, and localized edits to blocks, fields, actions, layouts, or reactions on an already-running app via backend flow-surfaces through nb api. Also handles AI employee / AI assistant action placement on UI surfaces. Hand off employee lifecycle work such as discovering, judging, creating, or configuring profile, prompt, model, skills, tools, or knowledge base to nocobase-ai-employee, then return for the UI write. Only hand off to nocobase-dsl-reconciler when the user explicitly asks for DSL, YAML, git, or cli push workflow. Does not handle ACL, data modeling, workflow orchestration, browser reproduction, page error postmortems, or non-Modern page navigation.
- `nocobase-utils` — General-purpose NocoBase reference utilities covering cross-cutting topics such as evaluator engines, expression syntax, UID generation, and more. Use when you need authoritative reference information or reusable snippets that apply across multiple NocoBase features.
- `nocobase-workflow-manage` — Use when users need to inspect, create, revise, enable, or diagnose NocoBase workflows through the `nb` CLI, including trigger selection, node-chain changes, version safety checks, and execution troubleshooting.
- `overview` — Use when the user asks anything about NocoBase v2 — "build app on NocoBase v2", "manage NocoBase", "how do I X in NocoBase", "NocoBase API or CLI". Establishes the cardinal rule (REST API or `nb` CLI — pick whichever is convenient) and routes to the right specialist skill in this plugin.
