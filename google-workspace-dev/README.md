# google-workspace-dev (Pi extension)

Google Workspace plugin powered by the official googleworkspace/cli (gws) Agent Skills. ~95 skills for Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Sheets, Docs, Chat, Meet, Tasks, Slides, Forms, Classroom and Admin — plus role personas and ready-made recipes — all driving the gws CLI. Vendored from upstream and auto-synced weekly. Requires the gws CLI (npm i -g @googleworkspace/cli) and a one-time OAuth setup.

## Install

Project-local (auto-discovered once the project is trusted):

```bash
cp -r .pi/ /path/to/your-project/
cp -r skills /path/to/your-project/
```

Global:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/extensions
cp .pi/extensions/google-workspace-dev.ts ~/.pi/agent/extensions/
```

Note: the extension resolves `skills/` two directories up from itself (`.pi/extensions/google-workspace-dev.ts` -> project root -> `skills/`). For a global install, also copy `skills/` next to `~/.pi/agent/` (i.e. `~/.pi/skills/`), or edit the `skillsDir` line in the extension file.

Quick test without installing: `pi -e ./.pi/extensions/google-workspace-dev.ts`
